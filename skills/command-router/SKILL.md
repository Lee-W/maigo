description: Codex pseudo-command router for Maigo. Use when the user sends or discusses any `/maigo:*` or `maigo:*` command, including go, team, quick, review, board, remember, memory, retro, crystallize, describe-pr, address-comments, triage-issue, take-issue, doctor, or repo-audit; also use when the user asks why Maigo commands do not behave like native Codex slash commands.

# Command Router

**Owner**: orchestrator
**Consumers**: Codex sessions only. Claude Code uses `commands/` as native slash commands.

## Boundary

Codex plugin manifests do not expose Claude Code-style `commands/` as native slash commands. Treat this skill as a compatibility shim:

- Improve model-side dispatch for Maigo-shaped input.
- Keep `commands/*.md` as the single source of truth; do not copy command behavior here.
- Do not promise slash-command autocomplete, command palette entries, or platform-level interception.
- Prefer `maigo:<name> ...` in Codex. A leading `/maigo:*` may be intercepted before it reaches the model.

## Dispatch

Accept all of these forms:

- `maigo:<name> [arguments...]`
- `/maigo:<name> [arguments...]` when it reaches the model
- Natural language clearly asking to run a Maigo command

For every recognized command:

1. Read `../orchestrator-voice/SKILL.md` completely.
2. Read `../narration/SKILL.md` completely.
3. Read `../../commands/<name>.md` completely.
4. Execute the command workflow with the remaining text as its argument string.
5. Read every additional skill or agent file required by that command before applying it.

Resolve Maigo-local references from the plugin root:

- `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` -> `../<skill>/SKILL.md` from this skill directory.
- `agents/<agent>.md` -> `../../agents/<agent>.md`.
- `commands/<command>.md` -> `../../commands/<command>.md`.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` -> the plugin root two directories above this skill.

Known commands:

| Input | Command source |
|-------|----------------|
| `maigo:address-comments` | `commands/address-comments.md` |
| `maigo:board` | `commands/board.md` |
| `maigo:crystallize` | `commands/crystallize.md` |
| `maigo:describe-pr` | `commands/describe-pr.md` |
| `maigo:doctor` | `commands/doctor.md` |
| `maigo:go` | `commands/go.md` |
| `maigo:memory` | `commands/memory.md` |
| `maigo:quick` | `commands/quick.md` |
| `maigo:remember` | `commands/remember.md` |
| `maigo:repo-audit` | `commands/repo-audit.md` |
| `maigo:retro` | `commands/retro.md` |
| `maigo:review` | `commands/review.md` |
| `maigo:take-issue` | `commands/take-issue.md` |
| `maigo:team` | `commands/team.md` |
| `maigo:triage-issue` | `commands/triage-issue.md` |

If `../../commands/<name>.md` does not exist, state that the command is not implemented and stop. Do not invent behavior.

## Codex compatibility

Translate Claude Code concepts without changing the workflow's intent:

- Ignore `allowed-tools` frontmatter as a permission declaration; use the tools actually exposed by the current Codex session.
- Map `AskUserQuestion` to structured user input when available. Otherwise ask one concise plain-text question and wait.
- Map explicit agent or `Task` delegation to Codex sub-agents when collaboration tools are available. If unavailable, execute the named roles sequentially in the main agent and disclose the fallback.
- Use Codex planning tools for command-level plans when available, while preserving `.maigo/*.md` artifacts required by the command.
- Use patch-based file editing and the current shell/tooling policies rather than Claude-specific Read, Write, Edit, or Bash tool names.
- Claude Code lifecycle hooks are not installed by the Codex manifest. Run the command's required review and verification steps explicitly; never claim that TeammateIdle or Stop hooks enforced completion.
- If a command needs to write outside the active workspace, request the required approval instead of silently skipping the write.

## Poor command UX

When the user reports that a Maigo entry is not behaving like a native slash command:

- Acknowledge the limitation directly.
- Recommend `maigo:<name>` or a natural-language request instead of starting with `/maigo:*`.
- Explain that this router improves model-side dispatch only; native slash-command UX requires Codex platform support.
